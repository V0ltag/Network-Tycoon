Network Tycoon - GUI Edition is a strategic simulation game where you manage a network of servers, protecting them from cyberattacks. As you progress, you must scan for vulnerabilities, set up firewall rules, and defend against random attacks. Each turn, you'll either successfully block an attack or lose money depending on whether your firewall is configured correctly. Track breaches and grow your resources as you make crucial decisions to keep your servers safe.

To install, make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher. Install the necessary libraries using pip install tkinter random, then download and save the script as network_tycoon_gui.py. To play, run the script with python3 network_tycoon_gui.py. Optionally, you can use PyInstaller to package the game into an executable by running pyinstaller --onefile --windowed network_tycoon_gui.py.
